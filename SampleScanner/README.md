# Locating and displaying recognized text

This sample code project demonstrates the Vision framework’s ability to perform optical character recognition (OCR) on an image you capture using your device’s camera. The `RecognizeTextRequest` structure generates a collection of objects that extract and describe an image's textual content. These objects provide information like the text string, the confidence of the observation’s accuracy, and the bounding box around the text’s location.

For more information about the app and how it works, see
